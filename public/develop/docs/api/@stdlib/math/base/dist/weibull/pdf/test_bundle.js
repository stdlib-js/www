/**
* Evaluates the natural exponential function.
*
* #### Method
*
* 1. We reduce \\( x \\) to an \\( r \\) so that \\( |r| \leq 0.5 \cdot \ln(2) \approx 0.34658 \\). Given \\( x \\), we find an \\( r \\) and integer \\( k \\) such that
*
*   ``` tex
*   \begin{align*}
*   x &= k \cdot \ln(2) + r \\
*   |r| &\leq 0.5 \cdot \ln(2)
*   \end{align*}
*   ```
*
*   <!-- <note> -->
*   \\( r \\) can be represented as \\( r = \mathrm{hi} - \mathrm{lo} \\) for better accuracy.
*   <!-- </note> -->
*
* 2. We approximate of \\( e^{r} \\) by a special rational function on the interval \\([0,0.34658]\\):
*
*   ``` tex
*   \begin{align*}
*   R\left(r^2\right) &= r \cdot \frac{ e^{r}+1 }{ e^{r}-1 } \\
*   &= 2 + \frac{r^2}{6} - \frac{r^4}{360} + \ldots
*   \end{align*}
*   ```
*
*   We use a special Remes algorithm on \\([0,0.34658]\\) to generate a polynomial of degree \\(5\\) to approximate \\(R\\). The maximum error of this polynomial approximation is bounded by \\(2^{-59}\\). In other words,
*
*   ``` tex
*   R(z) \sim 2 + P_1 z + P_2 z^2 + P_3 z^3 + P_4 z^4 + P_5 z^5
*   ```
*
*   where \\( z = r^2 \\) and
*
*   ``` tex
*   \left|  2 + P_1 z + \ldots + P_5 z^5  - R(z) \right| \leq 2^{-59}
*   ```
*
*   <!-- <note> -->
*   The values of \\( P_1 \\) to \\( P_5 \\) are listed in the source code.
*   <!-- </note> -->
*   The computation of \\( e^{r} \\) thus becomes
*
*   ``` tex
*   \begin{align*}
*   e^{r} &= 1 + \frac{2r}{R-r} \\
*           &= 1 + r + \frac{r \cdot R_1(r)}{2 - R_1(r)}\ \text{for better accuracy}
*   \end{align*}
*   ```
*
*   where
*
*   ``` tex
*   R_1(r) = r - P_1\ r^2 + P_2\ r^4 + \ldots + P_5\ r^{10}
*   ```
*
* 3. We scale back to obtain \\( e^{x} \\). From step 1, we have
*
*   ``` tex
*   e^{x} = 2^k e^{r}
*   ```
*
*
* #### Special Cases
*
* ``` tex
* \begin{align*}
* e^\infty &= \infty \\
* e^{-\infty} &= 0 \\
* e^{\mathrm{NaN}} &= \mathrm{NaN} \\
* e^0 &= 1\ \mathrm{is\ exact\ for\ finite\ argument\ only}
* \end{align*}
* ```
*
* #### Notes
*
* - According to an error analysis, the error is always less than \\(1\\) ulp (unit in the last place).
* - For IEEE double,
*   * if \\(x > 7.09782712893383973096\mbox{e+}02\\), then \\(e^{x}\\) overflows
*   * if \\(x < -7.45133219101941108420\mbox{e+}02\\), then \\(e^{x}\\) underflows
* - The hexadecimal values included in the source code are the intended ones for the used constants. Decimal values may be used, provided that the compiler will convert from decimal to binary accurately enough to produce the intended hexadecimal values.

/**
* Evaluates the exponential function.
*
* #### Method
*
* 1. Let \\(x = 2^n (1+f)\\).
*
* 2. Compute \\(\operatorname{log2}(x)\\) as
*
*   ``` tex
*   \operatorname{log2}(x) = w_1 + w_2
*   ```
*
*   where \\(w_1\\) has \\(53 - 24 = 29\\) bit trailing zeros.
*
* 3. Compute
*
*   ``` tex
*   y \cdot \operatorname{log2}(x) = n + y^\prime
*   ```
*
*   by simulating multi-precision arithmetic, where \\(|y^\prime| \leq 0.5\\).
*
* 4. Return
*
*   ``` tex
*   x^y = 2^n e^{y^\prime \cdot \mathrm{log2}}
*   ```
*
* #### Special Cases
*
* ``` tex
* \begin{align*}
* x^{\mathrm{NaN}} &= \mathrm{NaN} & \\
* (\mathrm{NaN})^y &= \mathrm{NaN} & \\
* 1^y &= 1 & \\
* x^0 &= 1 & \\
* x^1 &= x & \\
* (\pm 0)^\infty &= +0 & \\
* (\pm 0)^{-\infty} &= +\infty & \\
* (+0)^y &= +0 & \mathrm{if}\ y > 0 \\
* (+0)^y &= +\infty & \mathrm{if}\ y < 0 \\
* (-0)^y &= -\infty & \mathrm{if}\ y\ \mathrm{is\ an\ odd\ integer\ and}\ y < 0 \\
* (-0)^y &= +\infty & \mathrm{if}\ y\ \mathrm{is\ not\ an\ odd\ integer\ and}\ y < 0 \\
* (-0)^y &= -0 & \mathrm{if}\ y\ \mathrm{is\ an\ odd\ integer\ and}\ y > 0 \\
* (-0)^y &= +0 & \mathrm{if}\ y\ \mathrm{is\ not\ an\ odd\ integer\ and}\ y > 0 \\
* (-1)^{\pm\infty} &= \mathrm{NaN} & \\
* x^{\infty} &= +\infty & |x| > 1 \\
* x^{\infty} &= +0 & |x| < 1 \\
* x^{-\infty} &= +0 & |x| > 1 \\
* x^{-\infty} &= +\infty & |x| < 1 \\
* (-\infty)^y &= (-0)^y & \\
* \infty^y &= +0 & y < 0 \\
* \infty^y &= +\infty & y > 0 \\
* x^y &= \mathrm{NaN} & \mathrm{if}\ y\ \mathrm{is\ not\ a\ finite\ integer\ and}\ x < 0
* \end{align*}
* ```
*
*
* #### Notes
*
* - \\(\operatorname{pow}(x,y)\\) returns \\(x^y\\) nearly rounded. In particular, \\(\operatorname{pow}(<\mathrm{integer}>,<\mathrm{integer}>)\\) __always__ returns the correct integer, provided the value is representable.
* - The hexadecimal values shown in the source code are the intended values for used constants. Decimal values may be used, provided the compiler will accurately convert decimal to binary in order to produce the hexadecimal values.
*
*
* @param {number} x - base
* @param {number} y - exponent
* @returns {number} function value
*
* @example
* var v = pow( 2.0, 3.0 );
* // returns 8.0
* @example
* var v = pow( 4.0, 0.5 );
* // returns 2.0
* @example
* var v = pow( 100.0, 0.0 );
* // returns 1.0
* @example
* var v = pow( Math.PI, 5.0 );
* // returns ~306.0197
* @example
* var v = pow( Math.PI, -0.2 );
* // returns ~0.7954
* @example
* var v = pow( NaN, 3.0 );
* // returns NaN
* @example
* var v = pow( 5.0, NaN );
* // returns NaN
* @example
* var v = pow( NaN, NaN );

// a transform stream is a readable/writable stream where you do
// something with the data.  Sometimes it's called a "filter",
// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where
// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would
// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)
//
// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a
// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,
// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then
// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.
//
// Here's how this works:
//
// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable
// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)
// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes
// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until
// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.
//
// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When
// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the
// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single
// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first
// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into
// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.
//
// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,
// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,
// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering
// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is
// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many
// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in
// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small
// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In
// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell
// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could
// cause the system to run out of memory.
//
// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk
// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until
// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.
