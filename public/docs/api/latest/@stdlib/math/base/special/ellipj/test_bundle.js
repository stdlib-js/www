* Simultaneously computes the Jacobi elliptic functions sn, cn, and dn, and am.
*
* ## Notes
*
* -   Values are computed using the arithmetic-geometric from Abramowitz and Stegun 16.4.
* -   When m < 0 or m > 1, `sn`, `cn`, and `dn` are computed in terms of elliptic functions with 0 < m < 1 using the transformations from Abramowitz and Stegun 16.10 and 16.11, respectively. Thus the domain of m is any real number. When m < 0 or m > 1, `am` is not computed and will be returned as NaN.
* -   Values for small m (m < SQRT_EPS) are computed using the approximations of Abramowitz and Stegun 16.13. For each evaluation, the complete elliptic integral of the first kind, K(m), is computed in order to reduce the period and ensure valid output for all u.
* -   Values for m near unity (m > 1 - SQRT_EPS) are computed using the approximations of Abramowitz and Stegun 16.15. For each evaluation, the complete elliptic integral of the first kind, K(m), is computed in order to reduce the period and ensure valid output for all u.
*

/**
* Computes the complete elliptic integral of the first kind.
*
* ## Method
*
* -   The function computes the complete elliptic integral of the first kind in terms of parameter \\( m \\), instead of the elliptic modulus \\( k \\).
*
*     ```tex
*     K(m) = \int_0^{\pi/2} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - m sin^2\theta}} d\theta
*     ```
*
* -   The function uses a piecewise approximation polynomial as given in Fukushima (2009).
*
* -   For \\( m < 0 \\), the implementation follows Fukushima (2015). Namely, we use Equation 17.4.17 from the _Handbook of Mathematical Functions_ (Abramowitz and Stegun) to compute the function for \\( m < 0 \\) in terms of the piecewise polynomial representation of \\( m > 0 )).
*
*     ```tex
*     F(\phi|-m) = (1+m)^(-1/2) K(m/(1+m)) - (1+m)^(-1/2) F(\pi/2-\phi|m/(1+m))
*     ```
*
*     Since \\( K(m) \\) is equivalent to \\( F(\phi|m) \\), the above reduces to
*
*     ```tex
*     F(\phi|-m) = (1+m)^(-1/2) K(m/(1+m))
*     ```

/**
* Evaluates the natural exponential function.
*
* ## Method
*
* 1.  We reduce \\( x \\) to an \\( r \\) so that \\( |r| \leq 0.5 \cdot \ln(2) \approx 0.34658 \\). Given \\( x \\), we find an \\( r \\) and integer \\( k \\) such that
*
*     ```tex
*     \begin{align*}
*     x &= k \cdot \ln(2) + r \\
*     |r| &\leq 0.5 \cdot \ln(2)
*     \end{align*}
*     ```
*
*     <!-- <note> -->
*
*     \\( r \\) can be represented as \\( r = \mathrm{hi} - \mathrm{lo} \\) for better accuracy.
*
*     <!-- </note> -->
*
* 2.  We approximate of \\( e^{r} \\) by a special rational function on the interval \\(\[0,0.34658]\\):
*
*     ```tex
*     \begin{align*}
*     R\left(r^2\right) &= r \cdot \frac{ e^{r}+1 }{ e^{r}-1 } \\
*     &= 2 + \frac{r^2}{6} - \frac{r^4}{360} + \ldots
*     \end{align*}
*     ```
*
*     We use a special Remes algorithm on \\(\[0,0.34658]\\) to generate a polynomial of degree \\(5\\) to approximate \\(R\\). The maximum error of this polynomial approximation is bounded by \\(2^{-59}\\). In other words,
*
*     ```tex
*     R(z) \sim 2 + P_1 z + P_2 z^2 + P_3 z^3 + P_4 z^4 + P_5 z^5
*     ```
*
*     where \\( z = r^2 \\) and
*
*     ```tex
*     \left|  2 + P_1 z + \ldots + P_5 z^5  - R(z) \right| \leq 2^{-59}
*     ```
*
*     <!-- <note> -->
*
*     The values of \\( P_1 \\) to \\( P_5 \\) are listed in the source code.
*
*     <!-- </note> -->
*
*     The computation of \\( e^{r} \\) thus becomes
*
*     ```tex
*     \begin{align*}
*     e^{r} &= 1 + \frac{2r}{R-r} \\
*           &= 1 + r + \frac{r \cdot R_1(r)}{2 - R_1(r)}\ \text{for better accuracy}
*     \end{align*}
*     ```
*
*     where
*
*     ```tex
*     R_1(r) = r - P_1\ r^2 + P_2\ r^4 + \ldots + P_5\ r^{10}
*     ```
*
* 3.  We scale back to obtain \\( e^{x} \\). From step 1, we have
*
*     ```tex
*     e^{x} = 2^k e^{r}
*     ```
*
* ## Special Cases
*
* ```tex
* \begin{align*}
* e^\infty &= \infty \\
* e^{-\infty} &= 0 \\
* e^{\mathrm{NaN}} &= \mathrm{NaN} \\
* e^0 &= 1\ \mathrm{is\ exact\ for\ finite\ argument\ only}
* \end{align*}
* ```
*
* ## Notes
*
* -   According to an error analysis, the error is always less than \\(1\\) ulp (unit in the last place).
*
* -   For an IEEE double,
*
*     -   if \\(x > 7.09782712893383973096\mbox{e+}02\\), then \\(e^{x}\\) overflows
*     -   if \\(x < -7.45133219101941108420\mbox{e+}02\\), then \\(e^{x}\\) underflows
*
* -   The hexadecimal values included in the source code are the intended ones for the used constants. Decimal values may be used, provided that the compiler will convert from decimal to binary accurately enough to produce the intended hexadecimal values.
*
* @param {number} x - input value
* @returns {number} function value

* var v = exp( 4.0 );
* // returns ~54.5982

/**
* Computes the cosine on \\( \[-\pi/4, \pi/4] \\), where \\( \pi/4 \approx 0.785398164 \\).
*
* ## Method
*
* -   Since \\( \cos(-x) = \cos(x) \\), we need only to consider positive \\(x\\).
*
* -   If \\( x < 2^{-27} \\), return \\(1\\) which is inexact if \\( x \ne 0 \\).
*
* -   \\( cos(x) \\) is approximated by a polynomial of degree \\(14\\) on \\( \[0,\pi/4] \\).
*
*     ```tex
*     \cos(x) \approx 1 - \frac{x \cdot x}{2} + C_1 \cdot x^4 + \ldots + C_6 \cdot x^{14}
*     ```
*
*     where the Remez error is
*
*     ```tex
*     \left| \cos(x) - \left( 1 - \frac{x^2}{2} + C_1x^4 + C_2x^6 + C_3x^8 + C_4x^{10} + C_5x^{12} + C_6x^{15} \right) \right| \le 2^{-58}
*     ```
*
* -   Let \\( C_1x^4 + C_2x^6 + C_3x^8 + C_4x^{10} + C_5x^{12} + C_6x^{14} \\), then
*
*     ```tex
*     \cos(x) \approx 1 - \frac{x \cdot x}{2} + r
*     ```
*
*     Since
*
*     ```tex
*     \cos(x+y) \approx \cos(x) - \sin(x) \cdot y \approx \cos(x) - x \cdot y
*     ```
*
*     a correction term is necessary in \\( \cos(x) \\). Hence,
*
*     ```tex
*     \cos(x+y) = 1 - \left( \frac{x \cdot x}{2} - (r - x \cdot y) \right)
*     ```
*
*     For better accuracy, rearrange to
*
*     ```tex
*     \cos(x+y) \approx w + \left( t + ( r - x \cdot y ) \right)
*     ```
*
*     where \\( w = 1 - \frac{x \cdot x}{2} \\) and \\( t \\) is a tiny correction term (\\( 1 - \frac{x \cdot x}{2} = w + t \\) exactly in infinite precision). The exactness of \\(w + t\\) in infinite precision depends on \\(w\\) and \\(t\\) having the same precision as \\(x\\).
*
* @param {number} x - input value (in radians, assumed to be bounded by ~pi/4 in magnitude)
* @param {number} y - tail of `x`
* @returns {number} cosine
*
* @example
* var v = kernelCos( 0.0, 0.0 );

/**
* Computes the sine on \\( \approx \[-\pi/4, \pi/4] \\) (except on \\(-0\\)), where \\( \pi/4 \approx 0.7854 \\).
*
* ## Method
*
* -   Since \\( \sin(-x) = -\sin(x) \\), we need only to consider positive \\(x\\).
*
* -   Callers must return \\( \sin(-0) = -0 \\) without calling here since our odd polynomial is not evaluated in a way that preserves \\(-0\\). Callers may do the optimization \\( \sin(x) \approx x \\) for tiny \\(x\\).
*
* -   \\( \sin(x) \\) is approximated by a polynomial of degree \\(13\\) on \\( \left\[0,\tfrac{pi}{4}\right] \\)
*
*     ```tex
*     \sin(x) \approx x + S_1 \cdot x^3 + \ldots + S_6 \cdot x^{13}
*     ```
*
*     where
*
*     ```tex
*     \left| \frac{\sin(x)}{x} \left( 1 + S_1 \cdot x + S_2 \cdot x + S_3 \cdot x + S_4 \cdot x + S_5 \cdot x + S_6 \cdot x \right) \right| \le 2^{-58}
*     ```
*
* -   We have
*
*     ```tex
*     \sin(x+y) = \sin(x) + \sin'(x') \cdot y \approx \sin(x) + (1-x*x/2) \cdot y
*     ```
*
*     For better accuracy, let
*
*     ```tex
*     r = x^3 * \left( S_2 + x^2 \cdot \left( S_3 + x^2 * \left( S_4 + x^2 \cdot ( S_5+x^2 \cdot S_6 ) \right) \right) \right)
*     ```
*
*     then
*
*     ```tex
*     \sin(x) = x + \left( S_1 \cdot x + ( x \cdot (r-y/2) + y ) \right)
*     ```
*
* @param {number} x - input value (in radians, assumed to be bounded by `~pi/4` in magnitude)
* @param {number} y - tail of `x`
* @returns {number} sine
*
* @example
* var v = kernelSin( 0.0, 0.0 );
* // returns ~0.0
*
* @example
* var v = kernelSin( 3.141592653589793/6.0, 0.0 );

// MAIN //

/**
* Returns the last three binary digits of `N` with `y = x - Nπ/2` so that `|y| < π/2`.
*
* ## Method
*
* -   The method is to compute the integer (mod 8) and fraction parts of (2/π) * x without doing the full multiplication. In general, we skip the part of the product that are known to be a huge integer (more accurately, = 0 mod 8 ). Thus the number of operations are independent of the exponent of the input.
*
* -   (2/π) is represented by an array of 24-bit integers in `ipio2[]`.
*
* -   Input parameters:
*
*     -   `x[]` The input value (must be positive) is broken into `nx` pieces of 24-bit integers in double precision format. `x[i]` will be the i-th 24 bit of x. The scaled exponent of `x[0]` is given in input parameter `e0` (i.e., `x[0]*2^e0` match x's up to 24 bits).
*
*         Example of breaking a double positive `z` into `x[0]+x[1]+x[2]`:
*
*         ```tex
*         e0 = \mathrm{ilogb}(z) - 23
*         z = \mathrm{scalbn}(z, -e0)
*         ```
*
*         for `i = 0,1,2`
*
*         ```tex
*         x[i] = \lfloor z \rfloor
*         z = (z - x[i]) \times 2^{24}
*         ```
*
*     -   `y[]` output result in an array of double precision numbers.
*
*         The dimension of `y[]` is:
*         24-bit precision     1
*         53-bit precision     2
*         64-bit precision     2
*         113-bit precision    3
*
*         The actual value is the sum of them. Thus, for 113-bit precision, one may have to do something like:
*
*         ```tex
*         \mathrm{long\ double} \: t, w, r_{\text{head}}, r_{\text{tail}}; \\
*         t &= (\mathrm{long\ double}) y[2] + (\mathrm{long\ double}) y[1]; \\
*         w &= (\mathrm{long\ double}) y[0]; \\
*         r_{\text{head}} &= t + w; \\
*         r_{\text{tail}} &= w - (r_{\text{head}} - t);
*         ```
*
*     -   `e0` The exponent of `x[0]`. Must be <= 16360 or you need to expand the `ipio2` table.
*
*     -   `nx` dimension of `x[]`
*
*     -   `prec` an integer indicating the precision:
*         0 24 bits (single)
*         1 53 bits (double)
*         2 64 bits (extended)
*         3 113 bits (quad)
*
* -   External function:
*
*     -   double `scalbn()`, `floor()`;
*
* -   Here is the description of some local variables:
*
*     -   `jk` `jk+1` is the initial number of terms of `ipio2[]` needed in the computation. The minimum and recommended value for `jk` is 3,4,4,6 for single, double, extended, and quad. `jk+1` must be 2 larger than you might expect so that our recomputation test works. (Up to 24 bits in the integer part (the 24 bits of it that we compute) and 23 bits in the fraction part may be lost to cancellation before we recompute.)
*
*     -   `jz` local integer variable indicating the number of terms of `ipio2[]` used.
*
*     -   `jx` `nx - 1`
*
*     -   `jv` index for pointing to the suitable `ipio2[]` for the computation. In general, we want
*
*         ```tex
*         \frac{{2^{e0} \cdot x[0] \cdot \mathrm{ipio2}[jv-1] \cdot 2^{-24jv}}}{{8}}
*         ```
*
*         to be an integer. Thus
*
*         ```tex
*         e0 - 3 - 24 \cdot jv \geq 0 \quad \text{or} \quad \frac{{e0 - 3}}{{24}} \geq jv
*         ```
*
*         Hence
*
*         ```tex
*         jv = \max(0, \frac{{e0 - 3}}{{24}})
*         ```
*
*     -   `jp` `jp+1` is the number of terms in `PIo2[]` needed, `jp = jk`.
*
*     -   `q[]` double array with integral value, representing the 24-bits chunk of the product of `x` and `2/π`.
*
*     -   `q0` the corresponding exponent of `q[0]`. Note that the exponent for `q[i]` would be `q0-24*i`.
*
*     -   `PIo2[]` double precision array, obtained by cutting `π/2` into 24 bits chunks.
*
*     -   `f[]` `ipso2[]` in floating point
*
*     -   `iq[]` integer array by breaking up `q[]` in 24-bits chunk.
*
*     -   `fq[]` final product of `x*(2/π)` in `fq[0],..,fq[jk]`
*
*     -   `ih` integer. If >0 it indicates `q[]` is >= 0.5, hence it also indicates the _sign_ of the result.
*
* -   Constants:
*
*     -   The hexadecimal values are the intended ones for the following constants. The decimal values may be used, provided that the compiler will convert from decimal to binary accurately enough to produce the hexadecimal values shown.
*
* @private
* @param {PositiveNumber} x - input value
* @param {(Array|TypedArray|Object)} y - remainder elements
* @param {PositiveInteger} e0 - the exponent of `x[0]` (must be <= 16360)
* @param {PositiveInteger} nx - dimension of `x[]`
* @returns {number} last three binary digits of `N`

* Simultaneously computes the sine and cosine of a number and assigns results to a provided output array.
*
* ## Method
*
* -   Let \\(S\\), \\(C\\), and \\(T\\) denote the \\(\sin\\), \\(\cos\\) and \\(\tan\\), respectively, on \\(\[-\pi/4, +\pi/4\]\\).
*
* -   Reduce the argument \\(x\\) to \\(y1+y2 = x-k\pi/2\\) in \\(\[-\pi/4, +\pi/4\]\\), and let \\(n = k \mod 4\\).
*
* -   We have
*
*     | n | sin(x) | cos(x) | tan(x) |
*     | - | ------ | ------ | ------ |
*     | 0 |    S   |    C   |   T    |
*     | 1 |    C   |   -S   |  -1/T  |
*     | 2 |   -S   |   -C   |   T    |
*     | 3 |   -C   |    S   |  -1/T  |
*
* @private
* @param {number} x - input value (in radians)
* @param {Collection} out - output array
* @param {integer} stride - output array stride
* @param {NonNegativeInteger} offset - output array index offset
* @returns {Collection} output array
*
* @example
* var v = sincos( 0.0, [ 0.0, 0.0 ], 1, 0 );
* // returns [ ~0.0, ~1.0 ]
*
* @example
* var v = sincos( 3.141592653589793/2.0, [ 0.0, 0.0 ], 1, 0 );

*
* @example
* var v = sincos( -3.141592653589793/6.0, [ 0.0, 0.0 ], 1, 0 );
* // returns [ ~-0.5, ~0.866 ]

* e := exponent (11 bits)
* s := sign bit (1 bit)
*
* |-------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------|

* |-------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------|
* ```
*
* If little endian (more significant bits last):
*
* ```text
*                         <-- lower      higher -->
* |   f7       f6       f5       f4       f3       f2    e2 | f1 |s|  e1  |
* ```
*
* If big endian (more significant bits first):
*
* ```text
*                         <-- higher      lower -->
* |s| e1    e2 | f1     f2       f3       f4       f5        f6      f7   |

*
* In which Uint32 can we find the higher order bits? If little endian, the second; if big endian, the first.

// a transform stream is a readable/writable stream where you do
// something with the data.  Sometimes it's called a "filter",
// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where
// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would
// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)
//
// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a
// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,
// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then
// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.
//
// Here's how this works:
//
// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable
// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)
// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes
// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until
// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.
//
// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When
// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the
// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single
// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first
// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into
// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.
//
// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,
// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,
// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering
// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is
// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many
// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in
// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small
// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In
// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell
// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could
// cause the system to run out of memory.
//
// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk
// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until
// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.
