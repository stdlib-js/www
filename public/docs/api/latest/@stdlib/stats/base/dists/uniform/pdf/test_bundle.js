An accessor descriptor is a property described by a getter-setter function pair. A descriptor must be one of these two flavors and cannot be both.

* @param {Object} obj - object on which to define the property
* @param {(string|symbol)} prop - property name

* @param {boolean} [descriptor.enumerable=false] - boolean indicating if the property shows up when enumerating object properties
* @param {boolean} [descriptor.writable=false] - boolean indicating if the value associated with the property can be changed with an assignment operator
* @param {*} [descriptor.value] - property value
* @param {(Function|void)} [descriptor.get=undefined] - function which serves as a getter for the property, or, if no getter, undefined. When the property is accessed, a getter function is called without arguments and with the `this` context set to the object through which the property is accessed (which may not be the object on which the property is defined due to inheritance). The return value will be used as the property value.
* @param {(Function|void)} [descriptor.set=undefined] - function which serves as a setter for the property, or, if no setter, undefined. When assigning a property value, a setter function is called with one argument (the value being assigned to the property) and with the `this` context set to the object through which the property is assigned.

* @throws {TypeError} third argument must be an object

/**
* Defines (or modifies) an object property.
*
* ## Notes
*
* -   Property descriptors come in two flavors: **data descriptors** and **accessor descriptors**. A data descriptor is a property that has a value, which may or may not be writable. An accessor descriptor is a property described by a getter-setter function pair. A descriptor must be one of these two flavors and cannot be both.
*
* @param {Object} obj - object on which to define the property
* @param {string} prop - property name
* @param {Object} descriptor - property descriptor
* @param {boolean} [descriptor.configurable=false] - boolean indicating if property descriptor can be changed and if the property can be deleted from the provided object
* @param {boolean} [descriptor.enumerable=false] - boolean indicating if the property shows up when enumerating object properties
* @param {boolean} [descriptor.writable=false] - boolean indicating if the value associated with the property can be changed with an assignment operator
* @param {*} [descriptor.value] - property value
* @param {(Function|void)} [descriptor.get=undefined] - function which serves as a getter for the property, or, if no getter, undefined. When the property is accessed, a getter function is called without arguments and with the `this` context set to the object through which the property is accessed (which may not be the object on which the property is defined due to inheritance). The return value will be used as the property value.
* @param {(Function|void)} [descriptor.set=undefined] - function which serves as a setter for the property, or, if no setter, undefined. When assigning a property value, a setter function is called with one argument (the value being assigned to the property) and with the `this` context set to the object through which the property is assigned.
* @throws {TypeError} first argument must be an object
* @throws {TypeError} third argument must be an object
* @throws {Error} property descriptor cannot have both a value and a setter and/or getter
* @returns {Object} object with added property
*
* @example
* var obj = {};
*
* defineProperty( obj, 'foo', {
*     'value': 'bar'
* });
*
* var str = obj.foo;
* // returns 'bar'

// a transform stream is a readable/writable stream where you do
// something with the data.  Sometimes it's called a "filter",
// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where
// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would
// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)
//
// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a
// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,
// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then
// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.
//
// Here's how this works:
//
// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable
// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)
// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes
// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until
// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.
//
// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When
// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the
// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single
// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first
// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into
// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.
//
// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,
// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,
// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering
// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is
// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many
// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in
// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small
// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In
// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell
// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could
// cause the system to run out of memory.
//
// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk
// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until
// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.
